# prism template

A template to help you get started with [**prism**](https://github.com/PrismRL/prism).

## Installation

See the prism [installation guide](https://prismrl.github.io/prism/installation.html).

## Getting started

Follow the [tutorial](https://prismrl.github.io/prism/making-a-roguelike/part1.html) to turn this into a full game,
or just start hacking away.

## Building

This template includes a `makelove.toml` for use with the [makelove](https://github.com/pfirsich/makelove) build 
system that will build app images for Linux, Windows executables, as well as a web build based 
on [lovejs](https://github.com/Davidobot/love.js/). 

> [!WARNING]
> love.js is not an official platform for LÖVE and there are some incompatibilites with both LÖVE and LuaJIT, 
but we try to ensure prism is as compatible as possible.

You may want to check out other build systems as well, such as [love-build](https://github.com/ellraiser/love-build).
